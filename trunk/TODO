- Config file

- Autopilot!

- Add return / command direction across serial connection.

- Add update rate (ahrs/nav/etc.) values to the health structure so the
  ground station can evaluate the performance of the onboard computer.

- Add an altitude estimator based on the pressure sensor, but
  corrected over time by an average of the (gps - pressure) error.

x 2/14/2007: Better libstdc++ solution on stargate (hate to static link) :-(
  - copy libstdc++.so.5.0.5 and libgcc_s.so.1 from build tree
  - then we can dynamically link the ugear executable so it is a small upload
    and it will run on the host.
  - Not sure what else might break when libgcc_s.so.1 is replaced with a
    newer version, so heads up and eyes open ...
