MicroGear is an open-source embedded aerial robotics application written in C/C++.  MicroGear is designed to be robust, highly configurable, open, interfaceable, and feature rich.  Along with high levels of capability, MicroGear focuses on robustness, high performance, and minimal memory and disk footprints.

MicroGear is originally derived from the Xbow "MNAV" open-source autopilot.  It has since incorporated a number of source code modules and design and structural concepts from the FlightGear project.  The design focus of MicroGear is to offer a rich set of high functioning features and tools, rather than to write a minimilistic bare metal application for a specific processor and a specific application.

MicroGear has powered many hours of autonomous flight in a variety of airframes.  It is written with a strong focus on safety and robustness.
